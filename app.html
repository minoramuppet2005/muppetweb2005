<p>For this assignment, I decided to make a simple app themed on the internet phenomenon, Nyan Cat, an animated cartoon cat with a Pop-Tart torso flying through space and leaving a rainbow trail behind it. Not to mention the catchy song that plays with it, making it an addicting, well-known internet video. My goals for this app were relatively simple: it must feature the Nyan Cat music and a media source such as a picture, GIF, or video. As I explored the MIT app inventor platform, I first added a photo of Nyan Cat with an audio clip of the music attached. However, I found out you can add a video player, so I ended up attaching a shortened MPH3 file of the original Nyan Cat video to the app. This achieved all my goals for the app since it had the signature Nyan Cat music and animation. I completed it with a humorous caption at the top of the app, and it was finished. I was able to get the app on my phone easily with the MIT inventor app, which allows you to run the app on IOS 13 and higher, which luckily worked on my iPhone 14. And then he was done, in all its glory. Nyan Cat now lives on my phone, ready for me to play it whenever I want. Now, that's a party trick if I've ever seen one.</p>
	

<p> This assignment was very fun, and I learned a lot about design thinking, meaning how to take my ideas and make them a reality. I hope to do that more in this class and refine that process! </p>
