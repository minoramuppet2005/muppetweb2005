<h2> A little update on team sweet potato</h2>
	
<p>Update: Feb 2nd, 2025, 8:05pm. Okay okay, so this is going to be really funny. We haven't done anything. Group projects are the death of me. </p>
<p>I will say that our progess so far inlcudes: </p>
	
<ul>
	
	<li> We made a groupchat</li>
	<li> We spoke like two times in said groupchat</li>
	<li> I sent a bunch of youtube tutorials of ideas of what we could do for the project</li>
	<li> We scheduled to meet at 2pm before class today to start working on it</li>
	<li>That's pretty much it </li>
	<li> Oh, by the way, by researching I found lots of cool ideas like how to make games and even AI chatbots in the app inventor so we will likely decide what our project will be today and then start working on it.</li>
	<li>Now I'm just listing things. I really like lists. </li>
</ul>
	
	
	<p>Update: It's 1:59pm. No one is here. Ruh-roh.</p>
<p>Update: It's now 2pm... I'll give them a few minutes. </p>
<p> Team work!!</p>

<p>NEVERMIND. The team members are here! We decided to follow a tutorial to make flappy bird on the app inventor. Sounds cool and epic. We will be dividing the work with two people on the app, two people on the writing portion.</p>

	<p>Okay we are cooking now. We are hoping this app can beat that one girl who scored 20 points. It won't, but we can hope.</p>
